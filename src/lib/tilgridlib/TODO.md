# TODO
- [ ] Mask on resize or movement.
   In case some widgets laggs a bit on resizing due to computation,
   give the option to mask the widget until it's placed again.

- [ ] Better styling and styling configuration options (var's).
- [ ] Add vertical stretchability, for new and moving widgets.
- [ ] Add self-adjustment on out-of-bounds after container resize.
- [ ] Add "undo" feature by saving the current specs before updating the config.
- [ ] Add collision mechanism.
- [ ] Add min / max widget size (bind with rendered child?)

- [ ] Add style option; when resizing, only resize a dotted "border" before
   actually resizing the widget when letting go of the cursor.
